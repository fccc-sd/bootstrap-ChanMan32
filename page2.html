                    and my 15 year old sister have the same disgusting dad however my older sister 
                  and my other little sister have different dads
                    each of which were scumbags. My mother is 37, she was born in Hicksville
                    just like me and all three of my sisters. She graduated highschool 
                    and then went on to graduate collage with her batchler's degree while
                    taking care of my older sister. After that she decided to work in a factory
                    because she couldn't handle people that well. She met my "father" in a factory
                    in Hicksville. She ended up asking him to marry her. They were married for 10 years and 
                    my mother then became a stay at home mom in her 20s. My father was very 
                    manipulative and yelled at her over every little thing. Then when she finally 
                    made it out of the marrage she picked herself back up and started working
                    again. For like 6 months she was couch surfing and my 2 sisters had to stay with my father while I got 
                    sent to my grandmother (his mom) because my father didn't like me that much.  
                    After the 6 months she started renting a house at which point we all came back
                    to live with her. And then she met another scumbag at another factory in hicksville 
                    but this scumbag was 13 years older than her to put that into perspective, when she
                    was going into kindergarden he was going into his senior year in highschool. 
                    she was with 2 other scumbags that both cheated on her before him but they were less memorable. 
                    anyways while she was with him they had a child named Charleigh so not everything 
                    that came from that relationship was bad.

                Alex and I were in band together but I didn't really know him all that well until we started working together 2 years later. Joeseph I met back in 2nd Grade, I don't really remember how. 
                I met everyone else once I got into highschool. My freshman year, Joseph sat with the rest at lunch and I decided to sit with him and we all became pretty close friends until half of us 
                went to fourcounty and the other half didn't. Sometimes we see the friends that stayed at hicksville but we aren't nearly as close.

            Girlfriend 
        </h2>
        My girlfriend's name is Devon Smith (Her parents wanted a boy so they decided to give her a boy name) 
        I've known Devon since 7th grade and we've been friends since then, we were the only 2 trombone players in band. We started talking (as a situationship) 
        freshman year when Joeseph sat dat down at the table that she was sitting at (to talk to one of her friends that he was also friends with). I became part of her friend group pretty quickly and things just kinda went 
        on from there. We also think it's funny to tell people that we're married to get their reactions.
